                                Belonging to the dance pop genre, “Permission to Dance” sits on piano and string sounds that make the listeners bop their heads and bust some dance moves. World-renowned musician Ed Sheeran and British producer Steve Mac took part in making the song.</p>

The latter speaks on behalf of everyone stuck in the new normality brought on by COVID-19BTS echoes in a low voice the comforting message that in the face of unexpected turns “Life Goes On” and extends their hands towards the future.</p>

                                Lyrics that brutally lay open reality as it is deliver a bold admonition to a world that inflicts despair. Children are raised as studying machines without a chance to think about the future.
                                
                                A world where classmates are not friends but competitors trying to trample each other. BTS sings about the wounds and anguish that such hopeless life has left on today’s teens. .</p>
